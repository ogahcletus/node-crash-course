-----NEW CHUNK------Cletus Okibe Ogah
I graduated among the top 5% in chemical engineering with a CGPA 4.12 over 5.00 max.
I had brief exposure in onshore and offshore oil exploration and drilling as an intern before joining the banking industry where I worked as branch operations executive in various positions until I left after its acquisition as a Branch Head of Operations.
Presently, I seek suitable positions where I can seize opportunities to apply my diverse skills and learning experiences to contribute positively to viable goals and aspirations to prospective organizations especially those with international repute or with a supported culture of having the like growth potential.

Cletus Okibe Ogah
I graduated among the top 5% in chemical engineering with a CGPA 4.12 over 5.00 max.
I had brief exposure in onshore and offshore oil exploration and drilling as an intern before joining the banking industry where I worked as branch operations executive in various positions until I left after its acquisition as a Branch Head of Operations.
Presently, I seek suitable positions where I can seize opportunities to apply my diverse skills and learning experiences to contribute positively to viable goals and aspirations to prospective organizations especially those with international repute or with a supported culture of having the like growth potential.
